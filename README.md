## General Information
This project involves building a linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes based on various features.
The goal is to understand the factors affecting the demand for shared bikes in the American market and prepare to meet customer expectations.
The dataset used contains information on bike rentals, including weather conditions, time-related factors, and more.


## Conclusions
The top three features contributing to bike demand are :
Feature  Coefficient
3            yr  1975.903385
2      season_4  1897.855375
9  weathersit_3 -1873.112699
The variable with the highest correlation with 'cnt' is 'registered' with a correlation value of 0.95.
R-squared score on the test set: 0.83
